# Terraform: Up & Running Code

This repo contains the code samples for the book *[Terraform: Up and Running](http://www.terraformupandrunning.com)*,
**3rd edition**, by [Yevgeniy Brikman](http://www.ybrikman.com).




## Looking for the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd edition?

All the code examples in the `master` branch are for the 3rd edition of *Terraform: Up & Running*. If you're looking
for code examples for other editions, please see the following branches:

* [1st-edition branch](https://github.com/brikis98/terraform-up-and-running-code/tree/1st-edition).
* [2nd-edition branch](https://github.com/brikis98/terraform-up-and-running-code/tree/2nd-edition).
* [3rd-edition branch](https://github.com/brikis98/terraform-up-and-running-code/tree/3rd-edition).



## Quick start

All the code is in the [code](/code) folder. It is organized by language (terraform, bash, ruby, etc) and within each
language, by chapter. Since this code comes from a book about Terraform, the vast majority of the code consists of
Terraform examples in the [code/terraform folder](/code/terraform).

For instructions on running the code, please consult the README in each folder, and, of course, the
*[Terraform: Up and Running](http://www.terraformupandrunning.com)* book.
